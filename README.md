# Advanced Data Analysis Nano Degree - Udacity

## Overview 
  This Nano Degree consists of 3 main parts:
  1. Introduction to Data Analysis
      In this part, I've learned and practiced the process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. and I've practiced how to work with data using Python like Numpy and Pandas.
  3. Practical Statistics
     Here, I implemented inferential statistics and probability in important real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised Learning models.
  5. Data Visualization
     In this part, I implemented data visualization principles to the data analysis process. I used data analysis and visualization to tell a story with data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


  I've used the patient investigation dataset and implemented EDA and data profiling using Python libraries such as NumpyÙˆ Pandas and Matplotlib, which helped me understand the data and highlight some data discrepancies.
  some of the main questions I've answered are:
- What are the correlations between features such as (Age and No-show), (Diabetes and No-show), ....?
- How many of the patients are alcoholic, have diabetes, Hypertension, Scholarship, or handicap?
- Does receiving an SMS message affect your attendance at the clinic?
- How many females and males reserved an appointment? Did they show up?
- Did ending SMS to patients make an impact on showing up?
  
## Data Visualization 

In this project, I've used IMDB Movies Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

to answer some main questions after EDA and data profiling, data cleansing, and transformation then visualized the data using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
some of the questions I managed to answer through my data analysis process are: 

- What are the most correlated features?
- What is the most frequent language?
- What is the most frequent status of Movies?
- What are the distributions of the features?
- Is there a correlation between revenue, budget, and profit?
- What is the trend of budget, revenue, and profit?
- What is the most productive country for movies?
- What is the top 10 countries with production companies?
- What is the genre of movies with the highest median vote average, and in which status?

I went the extra mile and created a subset and investigated the Arabic Movies.

# Arabic Movies Questions:
What is the highest vote average in Arabic movies, What is its genre?
What is the highest vote count in Arabic movies, What is its genre?
